Notes on a possible project brainstorming activity night
------------------------------------------------------------
probably sticky notes
need wall space or movable whiteboards (Peloton probably has this)
OR: can we do it electronically?

note: data to be collected can be a project in itself

1. What is the problem to be solved? As briefly as possible.
Not at this stage "how to solve it"

E.g., it's hard for voters in Maine to know how their elected officials
have voted on issues they care about

2. Brainstorming ideas on paths for addressing the problem
probably multiple ideas/perspectives for now

3. For each path
a.

Open Maine â€“ Project Idea
(Skip any parts you want to, and feel free to write on the back!)

Your name:

Email:

Problem to be solved (brief / one sentence):

Details:

Some ideas about approaches / how to solve it (vague is fine):

Some ideas about people or agencies to contact for more info:

Any more thoughts to share?
------------------------------------------------------------
Write up at least one project idea:

    At least one or two sentences as a project overview
    A brief description of the information that would need to go into and out of the system
    A brief description of how this is done now
    A brief description of who the users of this system would be
    Talk to an actual person who might be a client, and briefly report their thoughts. It might turn out that their thoughts are negative (the project's not a good idea)... but you can still complete this assignment successfully by making it to this point.
