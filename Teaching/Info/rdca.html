<h4>The RDCA: A Brief History</h4>
In the Spring of 1992, three graduate students at the University of Michigan
-- <a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/~congdon/">Clare Congdon</a>, 
<a  href="http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/cmiller/">Craig Miller</a>, 
and Tom Montgomery -- went out for a seemingly
uneventful lunch at a nearby restaurant. The three were confronted with a
take-out special on red delicious apples; this led to small talk about red
delicious apples that revealed that the three were united in their high
disregard for this fruit. It was soon decided to form an organization, the
RDCA. 
<br><br>
We envisioned ourselves writing letters to airlines
and restaurants and convenience stores, demanding to be served apples
that have some flavor and texture. We envisioned boycotts and pickets.
Instead, we ended up with a poetry-writing campaign. Membership in the
RDCA has been granted to those who submit an original poem
deriding the red delicious apple. The founding members' poetry appears below.

<h4>Poems by Founding Members</h4>
<ul>

<li> <b>Red delicious: not for me!</b><br>
<i>by Clare Bates Congdon</i>

<pre>
In grocery stores all over town
a mealy, tasteless, fruit abounds
but strangely, they sell pounds and pounds
of red delicious apples

Its deep red hues shine in the light
attracting those whose tastes are slight
but as for me, no not one bite
of red delicious apples!

Despite this fruit's ubiquity
it's high in mediocrity
a red delicious? not for me
no red delicious apples
</pre>


<li> <b>Scam</b><br>
<i>by Craig S. Miller</i>

<pre>
On our subject, I have this to say:
Of all of the scams I've seen in my day,
There are none more pernicious
Than that of red delicious,
Garishly served on my luncheon tray.
</pre>


<li> <b>Red</b><br>
<i>by Tom Montgomery</i>

<pre>
Roses are red
Red delicious apples are too
But I wouldn't eat a rose
Or a red delicious apple, or two
</pre>
</ul>
