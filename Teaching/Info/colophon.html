<h3>Colophon</h3>

I'm a Mac/Unix user, and use Emacs and hand coding to produce most of my web
pages (although <a href="http://www.barebones.com/">BBEdit</a> has proven more
handy on numerous occasions). I use <a
href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/">SnapZ Pro</a> to make
screenshots; <a
href="http://www.lemkesoft.com/content/193/key-features.html">GraphicConverter</a>
is my utlity image editor.

<br><br>

The sequence motif logogram was made with <a
href="http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/">weblogo</a>, and I use <a
href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/">Adobe Illustrator</a> to
create vector drawings, such as the example phylogeny.

<h3>Clare's Explanation of a Colophon</h3>

<i>Webster's New World Dictionary, Second College Edition</i> provides the
following definition for colophon: 1. a notation often placed in a book, at
the end, giving facts about its production.
<br><br>

Colophons are seldom seen in modern-day books, but were commonplace in older
books, particularly in the era of hand-set type. The colophon was a place for
the designer of the book to communicate to others details about how the book
was produced. This might include information about the font used, how the
illustrations were produced, how the book was bound, how many copies were
printed, etc.
<br><br>

I'm making this up, but I believe the colophon fell out of use as books became
increasingly mass produced. These details are no longer interesting because
books are no longer made "by hand", and there is not much variation in the
production details of different books.
<br><br>

There is a parallel between the current state of HTML authoring and early
books in that others can reasonably be expected to be curious about how your
web pages are produced. There are many different ways to get text and graphics
up on the web, some of which require jumping through a particular set of
hoops. Did you use a specific web authoring tool? (Did you like it?)  If you
have graphics, where did they come from, and how did you get them into a
format that can be displayed on the web?
<br><br>

Many of us are still at the stage of making our web pages "by hand". Different
people have their different favorite methods of creating web pages, and the
details <i>are</i> interesting to others who produce web pages. I try to
include a colophon in major documents and hope to encourage you to do the
same.
