Of course, I'd be happy to write a letter of recommendation for you! It's part
of my job, for one thing. And you were always one of my favorites.
<p>

Here's my schtick:
<ol>
<li> <b><i>You write up a listing of what makes you great</i></b>, focusing on
   things that 
   I've had an opportunity to observe in you, and things that you hope
   I'll address in my letter. This list should include things like personal
   traits, specific courses you've taken with me and how you did in that
   situation, independent study projects you've done with me (or summer
   research) and how you did in that situation, and perhaps non-curricular
   activities as well. Among the things you might want to address are how you
   work with other people, how you work independently, and how you deal with
   adverse situations (such as difficult project partners).
<p>
   This is obvious, but be sure to highlight your individual strengths. For
   example, are you a great thinker, a programming whiz, meticulous with your
   work, especially creative, an inspiration to other students?

<p>
   It's good to throw in a "weak spot" or two as well (makes the letter more
   believable and you more human), and especially if there's a weak spot and
   evidence that you 
   can cope with it. This might be something like that you're too picky and
   that makes you have a hard time getting work in on time, that you're shy
   and don't always speak up in class discussions, or whatever.
<p>

   This "why I'm great" list is admittedly awkward to write, so let me explain
   the point of 
   it. On the one hand, you have specific reasons for asking ME to write a
   letter for you, and you've probably been thinking about that (or you should
   have been :-) and so it's all much fresher in your mind than it is in
   mine. Making the list helps make sure I don't forget anything. The second
   thing is that it gives you a good sense of what's going to be in your
   letter, because if there's something I disagree about, I'll let you know.
<p>
<li> You might also want to make it clear what sort of opportunity this is
     that you're pursuing and provide additional information about yourself
     that's relevant to this specific opportunity. (This is especially relevant
     if you've studied CS with me, but are pursuing a non-CS-related
     possibility.)
<p>
<li> <b><i>Send me a listing of places and deadlines.</i></b> You can also do
     this incrementally, as more opportunities arise.
<p>
<li> <b><i>Send me regular reminders about writing the letter.</i></b> When I've
   actually done 
   it, I'll send you email to let you know; until then, assume I haven't. And
   also know that I Do Not Mind the Reminders! I just have too many things
   going on, and this ensures that I don't forget.
<p>
<li> Perhaps this is obvious, but it's the first letter that takes the most
    time, after that adapting it for specific places is cake. So don't worry
    about asking for multiple letters.
<p>
<li> No, I'm not going to put a letter on file with career services. Just ask me
     when you need another letter.
</ol>

<b><i>Did I mention that you have to keep reminding me? Please do.</i></b> The
fact of the 
matter is that I have some other things to take care of before I write your
letters, and really, there's almost always dozens of things on my todo
list. Your regular reminders ensure that your letter doesn't inadvertently get
forgotten about.
